It seems more like a casual inquiry or statement that does not delve into university life or student opinions. The mention of '–∞–Ω–æ–Ω' (anon) suggests a level of anonymity that further distances the post from a personal educational experience. Overall, it does not meet the criteria for relevance as it does not provide insights into student life or educational themes."
